**#SkyView**
RHanbury has forked this to work on the SkyView part of the project only.
* Rotating icons were added by Nick Bonniere with Moshe Braner.
 * R Hanbury forked from Moshe Braner on 30/1/2025 and continued to edit.
 *  Make Alarms and Screens clearer and a couple of other preferences.
 *  Main objective is to make a LED Rose type and focussed alarm screen.
 *  And make ring display for transponder reception.

### Latest additions:

* vMB130: supports the GNS5892R ADS-B receiver module, on the T-Beam
* vMB123: supports baro sensor on the T-Echo ("Badge")
* vMB120: supports the latest 2024 radio protocol
* vMB114: import traffic data in GDL90 format (from ADS-B receiver)
* vMB110: added second serial port and data bridging (only on T-Beam)
* vMB10h: added winch mode ("aircraft type") with variable reported altitude
* vMB10f: auto turn-off Bluetooth upon web access to resolve memory limitation
* vMB10d: now works on the new v1.2 model of the T-Beam with AXP2101

### Beyond Lyusupov's version:

* Collision prediction for circling aircraft
* Can set aircraft ID for self, ID to ignore, and ID to follow
* Support 3-level collision alarms via buzzer
* Can configure two simultaneous NMEA output destinations
* Settable baud rate for serial output
* Estimates wind while circling, uses for collision prediction
* Corrected frequency hopping and time slots
* Airborne devices relay radio packets from landed aircraft 
* Louder buzzer via 2-pin differential drive, or external
* Collision-danger traffic VOICE warnings! (not just beeps)
* Can adjust SoftRF settings within T-Echo (without an app)
* Includes strobe-control logic
* Option to connect to ambient WiFi network instead of creating one
* Option to send data as TCP client instead of TCP server
* Specify server's IP address for TCP client, and choice of 2 ports
* Ability to use WiFi TCP & UDP NMEA outputs simultaneously
* These WiFi options allow wireless output to XCvario
* Detect and use OLED display on either I2C port
* Modified version of [SkyView](https://github.com/moshe-braner/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/ESP32/SkyView)
* [SkyStrobe](https://github.com/moshe-braner/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/ESP32/SkyStrobe) - a controller for a visibility strobe (and more)
* [Documentation files](https://github.com/moshe-braner/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/documentation).

Source code, and compiled binaries for [ESP32](https://github.com/moshe-braner/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/ESP32/SoftRF) and [nRF52](https://github.com/moshe-braner/SoftRF/tree/master/software/firmware/binaries/nRF52840/SoftRF/MassStorage) (only), are available here.
